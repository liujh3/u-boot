Documentation for PD1510 is now located at:
    doc/board/qualcomm/pd1510.rst

Note that the installation method has changed: U-Boot is now installed into the
"aboot" partition (replacing Little Kernel/LK). It is no longer packaged into
an Android boot image and loaded through Qualcomm's LK bootloader.
